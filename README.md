# Collection of SPARQL queries

This repo contains SPARQL queries that can be executed within VS Code,
using the [`zazuko.sparql-notebook`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Zazuko.sparql-notebook) extension.
Most of these queries were written to be executed against Apache Jena Fuseki endpoints
of servers running the [DSP](https://docs.dasch.swiss/latest/) software stack.
